# Impact of Hidden Layers in Machine Learning  

This project demonstrates the effect of **hidden layers** in a neural network using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
We trained two models on the same dataset:  
- **Model 1 (No Hidden Layers)** â†’ Accuracy: **93%**  
- **Model 2 (With Hidden Layers)** â†’ Accuracy: **99%**  

This shows how hidden layers help in capturing complex patterns and improving accuracy.  

## ðŸš€ Installation  
To run this project, install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
